# Steam Quick Switch
Steam Quick Switch is a software designed to make it faster switching between multiple Steam-accounts. 

## Usage
Before you start using the software, you should know that SQS can easily be accessed using the [ALT + Q]-hotkey.

When you start SQS you can see four buttons at the top. These are: the home-tab, the manage-tab, the hotkey-Button and the settings-tab.

- At the Home-tab, you simply press which ever account you want to log into.
- At the Manage-tab, you add your login-details for your accounts to appear on the Home-tab.
- The Hotkey-button acts like the [Alt + Q]-hotkey, minimizing SQS.
- At last: at the Settings-tab, you can change all the settings for SQS and most importantly: set a password for accessing the Manage-tab.


## Privacy

To store account-details, SQS uses encryption that uses Hardware-ID.

SQS does NOT store any data where it is not supposed to. Proof of this can be found in the source-code.
