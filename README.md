# Steam Quick Switch
Steam Quick Switch is a software designed to make it faster switching between multiple Steam accounts.

### Click [HERE](https://github.com/ReckTy/Steam-Quick-Switch/releases/download/v1.0.2/SQS.Setup.exe) to download
Since I'm a student, I don't really have the economy to spend $80 on a code signing certificate. This means that both your web browser and Windows will probably warn you about downloading Steam Quick Switch. 

## Usage
Before you start using the software, you should know that SQS can easily be accessed using the [ALT + Q] hotkey.

When you start SQS you can see four buttons at the top. These are: the home tab, the manage tab, the hotkey button, and the settings tab.

- At the home tab, you simply press whichever account you want to log into.
- At the manage tab, you add your login details for your accounts to appear on the home tab.
- The hotkey button acts like the [ALT + Q] hotkey, minimizing SQS.
- Lastly, at the settings tab, you can change all the settings for SQS and, most importantly, set a password for accessing the manage tab.


## Privacy

To store account-details, SQS uses encryption that uses hardware id.

SQS does NOT store any data where it is not supposed to. Proof of this can be found in the source-code.

## Extra Features

At the settings tab, there's a button called "Extra Features" containing: you guessed it, extra features! :D

Currently it only contains one feature, which is called "Import/Export game settings". It's pretty self explanatory.
With this feature, you can import and export settings between the games you have installed on Steam, which is pretty useful if you own the same game on multiple accounts.
